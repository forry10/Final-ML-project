# Final-ML-project
My final work on Machine Learning at University
This project was a self allocated project that I did in my final year, I was far more interested in Machine Learning and AI than I was with any of the offered dissertation options.

Shown in this repository is both the actual dissertation, and the code created during the course of working on it
